description: Introducing the summary page
---

With the code structure and architecture fixed,
the robot can finally be trusted (under detailed
direction about specific areas to edit in the code
and functions to change) to build a summary page.

The new "Summary" page shows mostly just events
with notes, notable events. Everything else is
collapsed into single rows.

Nice for an overview. No prior version of the app
has ever got this far.

It did a great job of this first time, then
as I instructed it to make a few tweaks it eventually
screwed everything up so badly I had to revert.

Only it hadn't been checking in new commits like it
had previously, so couldn't revert to that mostly
right first try.

And it's second try wasn't nearly as good on first
shot.

Still, eventually between us we managed to get there.

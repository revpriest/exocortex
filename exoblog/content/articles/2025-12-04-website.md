As a progressive web app, the app and the website are one 
in some sense. But can't help but feel that the pages
to describe the app and it's development should be separate.

I like to use <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>, build 
static sites that then don't need lots of back end power 
and databases and things.

So we use hugo and the 
<a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-cards/">hugo-cards</a>
to generate a bunch of files that can just be
copied into the public directory.

I manage all of this myself rather than letting the robot
do it. It's structure and methodology will be important to
have right and tweaking colours and things is still 
easier done editing a CSS file than having a robot edit
a CSS file for you.

So now the progressive web app will install all
the app pages and the main about page, but the
website with news and contact pages and things
is separate and only loaded as links are clicked.

Those pages are generated as a static site from Hugo
and can be easily hosted anywhere.

Description: "Adding a search function the the log app"
---

I added a search function to the log app.

Update with the section at the bottom of the
conf screen if you can't see it.

Search for whatever words in your log, so you 
can see when you noted you last saw someone or 
had the MOT done or whatever.

Pressing the event row in results brings up the day-dialog
to summarize and allow skip to that day.

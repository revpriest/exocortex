Description: "Adding a category management page showing stats and allowing rename and merge of categoriesg"

I added a cats page, which allows you to show the number 
of hours each day doing individual categories on a graph
of days or weeks or years if you have enough data.

It also has category management sections, allowing
merging and renaming of the categories to optimize
data for stats.

For instance, here in my own personal data:
![A graph as described](/news/img/2025/someCatStats.png "The personal graph")

We see that through September and October I was
in a routine of work and slack with a bit of
social a couple of times a week until the end
of November when I went away for social all
weekend, saw a demo of a person using Shakespeare,
and then when I got back started doing some
vibe-coding, in Red.

A break from that to go away at the weekend then
finish it off and publish a few days ago
since when Vibe Coding has dropped off a little.

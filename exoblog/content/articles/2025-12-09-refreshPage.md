Sadly it's possible for the installed Progressive Web
App to end up with a newer version of the index page
but still older versions of the cached files it loads.

This leaves it with just a blank page, no way to
even view the update-app section in the conf page.

If you get so stuck, you can visit [the refresh page](https://exocortexlog.com/refresh.html)
at [https://exocortexlog.com/refresh.html](https://exocortexlog.com/refresh.html) and
it will ask your browser to forget the old version
and so load the new.

Description: "Refresh page if things get suck"
---

Sadly it’s possible for the installed Progressive Web App to end up with a newer version of the index page but still older versions of the cached files it loads.

This leaves it with just a blank page, no way to even view the update-app section in the conf page.

If you get so stuck, you can visit the refresh page at https://exocortexlog.com/refresh.html and it will ask your browser to forget the old version and so load the new.

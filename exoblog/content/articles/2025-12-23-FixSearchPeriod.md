Description: "We fixed search!"

V0.1.13

The search system used to only look back 3 years.
I am the only person with more than three years
of data at the moment, but we fixed it so it looks
back the full log.

Didn't ask for that limit. Just something the machine
written code thought was a good idea I guess.
